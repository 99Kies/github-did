The keys and services listed are up the the controller, and you can create a DID Document simply by copying one of the examples above and updating the id property and keys.</p>\n<p>The entire security of this method relies on Github. Obviously, Github can censor, revoke, tamper or delete DIDs, which makes this method a “Centralized DID” or “Weak DID”, the terminology is still evolving, you can see a healthy debate <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-wg-charter/issues/22\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Managing Keys</h2>\n<p>Private keys associated with public keys listed in a document can be managed by various methods including, GPG, custom wallet systems, vaults or cloud based key management systems. Its obviously critical that private keys remain private, and that public keys are revoked (removed from documents), if private keys are compromised.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>You should now understand how to create a GitHub DID, using Github.com’s built in UI and the examples provided</p>\n<p>To learn how to use github-did’s custom test wallet and cli to manage keys, and create documents, head over to the <a href=\"/using-the-cli/\">using the cli</a> </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started","date":"April 29, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/getting-started/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/using-the-cli/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using the CLI"}}}}
