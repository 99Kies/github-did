This means less DIDs, but much simpler resolver, and much more user friendly identifiers. We think its worth it for now, and we can add more complex options later if more people are interested in contributing or using GitHub DID.</p>\n<p>This means that we also changed the format of the <code class=\"language-text\">didToDIDDocumentURL</code> function, which converts a “did” to a URL to a JSON-LD Document on github.com.</p>\n<p>The new format is: <code class=\"language-text\">https://github.com/OR13/ghdid/blob/master/index.jsonld</code></p>\n<p>We did this because it unlikely to conflict with any existing repo, and we thougt it might be cool to link the cli binary <code class=\"language-text\">ghdid</code> to the repo that a user uses to store their GitHub DID.</p>\n<p>If you hate this idea, <a href=\"https://github.com/decentralized-identity/github-did/issues/new\">please open an issue</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"V2 Even More Centralized","date":"May 14, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/v2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/moving-to-dif/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Moving to DIF"}},"next":null}}
